# Step 1
Code affected: none
Created this file.

#########
# Step 2
Code affected: all .java files
Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.

#########
# Step 3
Code affected: Fish.turnAround
Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.
Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.

I realised that there are a lot of changes I need to make from the previous revision as
most of the revisions only utilised the Inspect Code function of Android Studio.

From this experience, I realised that I need to draw a memory model and understand thoroughly,
what each and every code are doing in order to proceed. So, below is the better revision I made.

#########
# Step 4
Code affected: Items.java
Flaw: Apparently, some of the items like bubble, seaweeds, fish, and hungryfish have methods that
are in common.
Fix: Hence, instead of repeating it in every class, we will make an abstract class Item to have the
abstract methods, variables and constructors.

#########
# Step 5
Code affected: Items.java
Flaw: No variable has been added.
Fix: Since all items have a coordinate somewhere, I am adding 2 variables int x

#########
# Step 6
Code affected: Items.java
Flaw: No abstract constructor has been added
Fix: Adding a Items constructor with variable int x, and int y and a method body


#########
# Step 7
Code affected: Items.java
Flaw: No methods have been added yet
Fix: Add the abstract method draw(Canvas canvas) and moveItem() in Items.java


#########
# Step 8
Code affected: Items.java
Flaw: No abstract constructor has been added
Fix: Adding a Items constructor with variable int x, and int y and a method body


#########
# Step 9
Code affected: Bubble.java
Flaw: Bubble is a an item in a Fish tank which can be inherited from Items.
Fix: Extend Bubble to Items.

#########
# Step 10
Code affected: Bubble.setLocation()
Flaw: Bubble.setLocation is no longer useful as we change the coordinate system.
Fix: Erased it

#########
# Step 11
Code affected: Bubble constructor
Flaw: Use the abstract constructor and inherit it to bubble
Fix: Use the abstract constructor and inherit it to bubble

#########
# Step 12
Code affected: Bubble.draw() and Bubble.drawString()
Flaw: Since the method drawString() is a very simple helper function for draw(), we
can simply merge them together
Fix: Put the body of drawString() to draw() with few modifications to fir the method.

#########
# Step 13
Code affected: Bubble.floatStraight(), Bubble.floatLeft(), and Bubble.floatRight()
Flaw:
1. Since the code for the difference appearance of the bubbles are the same,
we can merge this process together.
2. Since we can manage the randomness of the number to manage whether the bubble should
go to the right or the left or straight up, we can simply merge these processes together.
Fix: Merge these together into a simpler if conditions.

#########
# Step 14
Code affected: Seaweed.java
Flaw: Seaweed is an item in the Tank, we can extend Items to Seaweed
Fix: Extend it.

#########
# Step 15
Code affected: Seaweed.my_curr_row and Seaweed.my_curr_col
Flaw: Since we have an abstract class Items, we can use the abstract constructors to
save the x and y coordinate.
Fix: So, we delete it.

#########
# Step 16
Code affected: Seaweed.setLocation()
Flaw: There's no longer a need for this method
Fix: Erase it

#########
# Step 17
Code affected: Seaweed constructor
Flaw: Seaweed constructors need to use abstract constructor Item.
Fix: call super in it.

#########
# Step 18
Code affected: Seaweed.draw()
Flaw: There are still old variables that in the method draw()
Fix: Change it my_curr_row and my_curr_col to x and y respectively.

#########
# Step 19
Code affected: Seaweed.draw()
Flaw: The if statements can be simplify further, so it is more effecient.
Fix: Change the if conditions and body to a better one.

#########
# Step 20
Code affected: Seaweed.wave()
Flaw: To align ourselves with the abstract class, we need a method called moveItem()
to be implemented, which will move the item and wave() do exactly the same.
Fix: Change the name from wave() to moveItem()

#########
# Step 21
Code affected: Fish.java
Flaw: Fish is an item in the fish tank, so it needs to be inherited from Items
Fix: extends Fish to Items

#########
# Step 22
Code affected: Fish.r and Fish.c
Flaw: These are no longer needed as we can simply apply super on the constructor to
store the coordinates value.
Fix: Erase variable r and c


#########
# Step 23
Code affected: Fish.setLocation()
Flaw: It is no longer needed due to a different coordinate system that we make
Fix: Erase it


#########
# Step 24
Code affected: Fish.blowBubble()
Flaw: We need to modify blowBubble() according to the new implementation of Bubble
Fix: Modifying the old bubble to a new one.
